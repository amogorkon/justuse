"""Here live all the tests that are expected to fail because their functionality is not implemented yet.
Test-Driven Development is done in the following order: 
    1. Create a test that fails.
    2. Write the code that makes the test pass.
    3. Check how long the test took to run. 
    4. If it took longer than 1 second, move it to integration tests. Otherwise, move it to unit tests.
