Hi! Thank you for your interest in contributing to justuse :)

Besides tackling [good first issues](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), there is plenty other stuff to do - like writing unit tests and documentation, finding bugs and report them or coming up with new ideas and questions to keep us on our toes.

For general ideas and questions, you can use [github discussions](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/discussions), for documentation please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/amogorkon/justuse/wiki) and for discussions regarding code, and always feel free to join our [slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0297SNMCHY).

If you want to contribute code, be aware that we (at least I do) run black/brunette to enforce proper code formatting. 
You can use any indentation style (2,3,4 spaces, tabs..) you like on your side, but don't complain if they get mangled to 4-space indentation. Please follow PEP8 as far as is reasonable.

Please make sure that your code is properly commented - always ask yourself "would future self immediately understand why I wrote it like this in a year from now?" if the answer is no, add a comment.
And please try to refrain from code golfing. We all know the temptation, but.. :)

To streamline commit messages, automatically managing issues and making them generally more useful for debugging, please follow [How to write good commit Messages](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/)

Well, that's it. Welcome aboard!
